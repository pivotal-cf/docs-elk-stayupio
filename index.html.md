## Provisioning and Binding via Cloud Foundry

Once you have installed the product, it automatically registers itself with your Elastic Runtime. At this point, the product is available to your application developers, either in the Marketplace in the web based console, or via `cf marketplace`. They can add, provision, and bind the service to their applications like any other CF service:

```
$ cf create-service p-redis shared-vm redis
$ cf bind-service my-application redis
$ cf restart my-application
```

## Security
The following ports & ranges are used in this service:

* Destination port 80 access to the service broker from the cloud controllers
* Destination port 6379 access to all dedicated nodes from the DEA network(s)
* Destination ports 32768 to 61000 on the service broker from the DEA network(s). This is only required for the shared service plan.

## Example Application
